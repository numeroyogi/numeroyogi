## Sodomy, Attempt to Rape & 42 Years Coma

**Aruna Ramachandra Shanbaug** was a staff Nurse working in King Edward Memorial Hospital, Parel, Mumbai. On 27.11.1973, Aruna was attacked by a sweeper/ward boy Sohanlal Bhartha Walmiki in the hospital who wrapped a dog chain around her neck and yanked her back with it. Sohanlal tried to rape Aruna but finding that she was menstruating, he sodomized her. To immobilize her during this act he twisted the chain around her neck.

The next day on **28.11.1973**, a cleaner found her lying on the floor with blood all over in an unconscious condition. Due to strangulation by the dog-chain, the supply of oxygen to the brain stopped and the brain (cortex) got damaged. She also had brain stem contusion injury with associated cervical cord injury. Sohanlal was sentenced to 7 years imprisonment for his offence, & released in 1980. The Supreme Court rejected petition (filed by Pink Virani) seeking passive euthanasia (death by own will) on 7 March 2011. Aruna died of pneumonia on 18.05.2015, after being in a persistent vegetative state for nearly 42 years.
