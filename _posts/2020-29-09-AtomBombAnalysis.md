## "FATHER OF ATOM-BOMB”

Julius Robert Oppenheimer was an American theoretical physicist and professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley. Oppenheimer was credited being the "Father of Atomic Bomb" for their role in the Manhattan Project, the World War II undertaking that developed the first nuclear weapons. The first atomic bomb was successfully detonated on July 16, 1945, in the Trinity test in New Mexico. 

Oppenheimer later remarked that it brought to mind words from the Bhagavad Gita: 
> "Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds." 

In August 1945, the weapons were used in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The case study is confined to numero-analysis of Atom Bomb & its inventor.

## Numero Analysis

1. Oppenheimer birth date itself showing a combination of ingredients (secret) of bomb 22.04.1904 [2,2,4,1,9,4] besides his BN-22/4, DN-22/4 & ZN-6 (Tau.), particularly BN/DN-22/4 revealing full “Rahu Energy” confirming his ‘destined role’ towards invention of Atom-Bomb.

3. BN/DN-4 & ZN-6 when blended together may become more powerful & negative (in not channelized towards positive/righteous path), No.6 may be tend to do anything for its benefit/luxury/fame. 

5. Julius Robert Oppenheimer original name FNN-20 & NN-79/7 depicting a man with FNN-20 if work with personal motives, they are extremely selfish and “highly destructive”. NN-79 ensure fame after initial life struggle. 

7. Robert Oppenheimer, famous name having FNN-22 & NN-77/5. It is said that they may move towards “self-destruction at a great speed & surround by wicked/frauds, earn bad reputation”. NN-77 denotes self-confidence, hard work, and fame/honor. 

9. Oppenheimer’s BN/DN/FNN-22/4 (triple-4) blended with NN-77/5, ZN-6 paved his way towards this most ‘destructive bomb’ of the world, which was tested on 16.07.1945 (7&6).

11. In World-War-II two Japanese cities have seen the destruction by bombardment of Atom Bombs, on 06.08.1945 (6&6): Hiroshima [29/2] killing 1, 29,000 people and on 09.08.1945 (9&9) Nagasaki [17/8] killing 2, 26,000 people. Bombardment dates relation with cities showing their vital roles.
